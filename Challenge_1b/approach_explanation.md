# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a persona-driven document intelligence system that extracts and prioritizes relevant content from document collections based on specific user personas and their job-to-be-done tasks. The approach combines natural language processing, machine learning, and domain-specific heuristics to deliver personalized document analysis.

## Core Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses `pdfplumber` for robust text extraction while preserving page structure and metadata
- **Section Identification**: Employs pattern matching and text analysis to identify document sections using header detection algorithms
- **Content Structuring**: Organizes extracted content into hierarchical sections with page numbers and word counts

### 2. Persona Profile Generation
- **Role Analysis**: Extracts key characteristics from persona role descriptions
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaks down job-to-be-done into actionable focus areas
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies domain-specific terminology using NLTK tokenization and stopword filtering
- **Focus Area Mapping**: Maps personas to relevant content categories (e.g., travel planner â†’ itineraries, accommodations)

### 3. Relevance Scoring Engine
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts document sections and persona profiles into numerical vectors using scikit-learn
- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates semantic similarity between document content and persona requirements
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Combines content relevance, section importance, and persona-task alignment

### 4. Content Prioritization
- **Importance Ranking**: Sorts extracted sections by relevance scores to identify top-priority content
- **Subsection Analysis**: Generates refined summaries using sentence scoring and key information extraction
- **Quality Filtering**: Removes low-relevance content to focus on most valuable sections

## Technical Implementation

The system processes multiple document formats while maintaining efficiency constraints:
- **CPU-Only Processing**: Optimized for CPU execution without GPU dependencies
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming text processing to handle large document collections
- **Performance Optimization**: Vectorized operations and efficient algorithms ensure <60 second processing time

## Output Generation

Results are structured in standardized JSON format containing:
- **Metadata**: Input documents, persona information, and processing timestamps
- **Extracted Sections**: Top-ranked sections with importance scores and source references
- **Subsection Analysis**: Refined text summaries optimized for persona-specific consumption

This approach ensures scalable, accurate, and persona-relevant document analysis across diverse domains and use cases.
